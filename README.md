## My process

  I started by analysing the project, then created a github repository and put all the necessary files in it.
  Then I started on the CSS side by applying a CSS reset, and creating some custom properties, and some utility classes.
  After setting up the CSS, I was ready to start with the actual markup, this challenge has a fairly simple HTML, which didn't take much time.
  When the HTML was done, it was time to do some general styling on the CSS and making it responsive using the media queries.
  And that is pretty much my whole process, thank you for reading!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

With this project I learnt how to use custom properties, and the importance of using utility classes to make the styling more simple. And I learned to style for mobile first.


### Continued development

I want to continue practicing Flexbox and Grid, they really help with responsive design. And I want to learn JS in order to become a full on frontend dev. Wish me luck!
